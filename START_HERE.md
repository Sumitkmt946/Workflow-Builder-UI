## 💡 How It Works

### The Flow
1. Start with a "Start" node
2. Right-click to add children
3. Create a workflow tree
4. Edit node labels anytime
5. Delete nodes (children auto-reconnect)
6. Save for later use

### Behind the Scenes
- Tree data structure for nodes
- Recursive algorithms for operations
- Immutable state updates
- localStorage persistence
- SVG for connections
- CSS for animations

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Use Locally
```bash
npm start
# Use the app at http://localhost:3000
```

### Option 2: Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy the build/ folder anywhere
```

### Option 3: Review Code
- Check `src/` folder for implementation
- Read the 6 documentation files
- Review TypeScript types

## 🌟 Highlights

### Auto-Reconnection Logic
When you delete a node with children, the parent automatically connects to those children. This is the **most complex feature** and it's fully implemented!

### Smart Layout
Nodes automatically position themselves based on their parent and siblings. No manual positioning needed!

### Type Safety
Full TypeScript with strict mode. Every variable is typed. This catches bugs before runtime!

### Responsive Design
Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile. Try resizing your browser!

## 🎉 Ready to Go!

Everything is set up and ready to use. Just run:

```bash
npm start
```

Then:
1. Try adding a few nodes
2. Edit some labels
3. Delete a node to see auto-reconnection
