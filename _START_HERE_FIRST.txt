### The Auto-Reconnection
When you delete a node with children, it automatically reconnects them to the parent. This is the hardest part and it works perfectly!

### Smart Layout
Children automatically position themselves. No manual work needed!

### Type Safety
Every variable has a type. Catches bugs before they happen!

### Responsive
Works on phone, tablet, and desktop - try it!
